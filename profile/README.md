Our proposal is to present different types of systems with different software architectures, system designs and technologies using Golang.
You can read the README of each system and implement it yourself before seeing our solution. This way, you can practice your system implementation
and also see different approaches to solving the same problems

See the [Gopher Systems guide](https://github.com/gopher-systems/guide) to learn how to contribute and practice systems

## Difficulty

Filter the systems by difficulty of implementation

- [Very easy](https://github.com/orgs/gopher-systems/repositories?q=topic:very-easy) ü¶é Basically a CRUD
- [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/gopher-systems/repositories?q=topic:easy) üê¢ Basic software and networking concepts
- [Moderate](https://github.com/orgs/gopher-systems/repositories?q=topic:moderate) üê∏ More complex use cases and architectures
- [Difficult](https://github.com/orgs/gopher-systems/repositories?q=topic:difficult) üêä Distributed systems and network protocols
- [Very difficult](https://github.com/orgs/gopher-systems/repositories?q=topic:very-difficult) ü¶ñ Now scale that to millions
